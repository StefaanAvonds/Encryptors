# Encryptors
An application to encrypt a text using any encryptor.

If you want to add a new encryptor, you need to do a few things:

1) Add a new enumeration-item with the name of the new encrypting method;

2) Add a new class in the folder "Encryptions". This will contain the actual encrypting;

3) Add a new item to the dictionary in the EncryptionManager in folder "Managers".
